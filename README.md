# How it works
## Preprocess Image
The techniques used to preprocess the image is by resizing the image into 128 x 128. Then this image is resized into float so that it is divisible by 255.

## Model
The model used is CNN, the input size is 128 x 128 with 3 color channel (RGB). Inside it there are also 2 hidden layers. In the last layers, there is a list of nodes which represents the number of labels that exists that the model can understand
